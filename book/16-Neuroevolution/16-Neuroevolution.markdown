# Neuroevolution

This chapter opens the third and last part of the book. The first part covers the topic of neural network, a metaphor for a natural brain. The second part covers genetic algorithm, a metaphor for mechanism that enable evolution of species. Neuroevolution is a form of artificial intelligence that combines neural network and genetic algorithm. 

# Supervised Learning

In the first part, we have seen that neural network requires example to operate. For example, in order for a neural network to learn a behavior a labeled dataset has to be provided. In many situations, obtaining such a dataset is not problematic. For example, Facebook has a large dataset of labeled pictures. Each time you label a friend in a picture, you provide an example with which Facebook can improve its models. 

There are some case where having a labeled dataset is difficult, too costly, or even impossible to produce at an adequate quality.
