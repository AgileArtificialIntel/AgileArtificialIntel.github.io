# Combining Genetic Algorithm with Neural Network

# Why doing so?

We have seen that the backpropagation mechanism is pretty effective.
This is very true. Backpropagation assumes that you know how to train the network. Such training requires some examples data. However, there are some situations for which it is complicated to have some examples. Consider, for example, a small game. 

# Principle

Use Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal set of weights and biases.
