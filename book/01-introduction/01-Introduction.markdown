# Introduction


## The book series

The field of artificial intelligence has seen a massive growth recently. _Agile Artificial Intelligence_ is a book series that covers the most expressive and popular algorithms used in the field. The contribution made by the series is to bring agility in the way techniques related to artificial intelligence are designed, implemented, and evaluated. 

This first volume covers neural networks and some applications of it. We voluntarily excluded image and natural language processing as their deserve to be treated individually.



## Why this book?

There exist many sophisticated libraries to build, train, and run neural networks. So, why this book? 

Most of artificial intelligence techniques are often perceived as a black box that operates in an almost magical way. The purpose of Agile Artificial Intelligence is to reveals some of the most arcane algorithms. This book details how neural networks may be written from scratch, without any supporting libraries.

Understanding the machinery behind fantastic algorithms and techniques is a natural goal that one should pursue. This first allow one to (i) easily hook into if necessary, and (ii) understand the scope of these algorithms. 

This book is meant to detail some easy-to-use recipes to solve punctual problems and highlights some technical details using the Pharo programming language. 

## Requirements to read this book

Agile Artificial Intelligence is designed to have a large audience. In particular, there no need to have knowledge in neural networks. There is even no need to have strong mathematical knowledge. Some chapters requires a mild mathematical background. However, these chapters are optional for the reading and may be safely skipped.

## What if I am not a Pharo programmer?

Code provided in this book use the Pharo programming language. Using Pharo is very convenient as an application does not need to be complete to be run and tested. Moreover, the use of the Roassal visualization is essential in several places.

Pharo has a very simple syntax, which means that even for a Java programmer, code should be understandable. Chapter 2 also presents the Pharo programming language and environment. 

## Additional Readings

If you want to know more about some of the techniques presented here, we recommend the following books:

If I want to know more about Pharo:
- http://pharo.org is the official website about Pharo.
- http://books.pharo.org contains many books and booklets about Pharo.
- http://agilevisualization.com describes the Roassal visualization engine, which also provide a gentle introduction to Pharo.
