# Future books
_Programming Neural Networks in Pharo_ is the first book of the Agile Artificial Intelligence series. Future book will cover the field of genetic algorithm, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Stay tuned!

# Big thanks!
Since the announcement of the book many have encouraged us, provided feedback, and improved the writting. In no particular order, we are grateful to 
Chris Thorgrimsson, CH, Torsten Bergmann.

We are also deeply grateful to 
- Lam Research for sponsoring part of this work
- INRIA Chile for helping us with the infrastructure
